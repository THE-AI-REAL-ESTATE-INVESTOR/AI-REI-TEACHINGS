## Using Patterns

### Basic Syntax
```bash
fabric -p=pattern_name -v="#text:your_content"
```

### Common Options
- `-t`: Adjust temperature (creativity)
- `-c`: Copy to clipboard
- `-o`: Output to file
- `-s`: Stream output
- `-l`: List patterns

### Best Practices
1. Start with clear objectives
2. Use appropriate temperature settings
3. Review and refine outputs
4. Save important results
5. Combine patterns for complex tasks

## Tips for Success
- Test patterns with small inputs first
- Use pattern combinations for better results
- Save successful prompts for reuse
- Adjust settings based on needs
- Review outputs carefully
