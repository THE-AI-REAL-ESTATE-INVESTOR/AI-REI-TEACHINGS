# Join Our AI Real Estate Tech Revolution! üöÄ

## This public branch is just the tip of the iceberg! üèîÔ∏è

Hey there! I'm Mark, an entrepreneur turned developer, and I'm looking for passionate people who want to **learn as much as contribute** to this exciting project.

## Why You Should Join Us üí°

For starters, this is a fantastic opportunity to:
- Learn how to leverage AI automation in real-world applications
- Improve your GitHub skills and development practices
- Become a better all-around developer in the AI age

I believe AI automation is changing the job landscape rapidly. Rather than worry about it, I want to **build something that helps put more developers to work** by creating new opportunities with AI.

## Where We Need Help üõ†Ô∏è

If you'd like to be part of our discussions and get invited to the main branch, we need help with:
- **ORGANIZING**: Making sense of our codebase and documentation
- **MAINTENANCE**: Keeping everything running smoothly
- **QUALITY ASSURANCE**: Ensuring our products work flawlessly
- **RECRUITING**: Finding more talented people to join us
- **IDEATION**: Coming up with new features and solutions
- **CI-CD**: Improving our deployment pipeline
- **SECURITY**: Keeping our applications safe

## Our Vision üî≠

We're building a comprehensive platform that includes:

1. **AI-Powered Blogging Platform** ([freeblog.aireinvestor.com](https://freeblog.aireinvestor.com))
   - Submit a URL and our custom AI persona "Eva" writes a great blog post
   - Backend Go app using Fabric CLI tools for AI prompting
   - Beautiful, better-than-ChatGPT front-ends

2. **Business Consulting Services** ([aireinvestor.com](https://aireinvestor.com))
   - AI business consulting ($1500 consultations, $100 AI calls)
   - Development operations transformation
   - Smart AI employees for real estate investors

3. **Educational Resources** ([learn.aireinvestor.com](https://learn.aireinvestor.com))
   - Automatically generated content via GitHub Pages
   - YouTube API integration for up-to-date framework information
   - Daily blog posts generated through our AI system

## Technical Stack üíª

- Next.js 15 with React 19
- Appwrite for user authentication
- OpenRouter for flexible AI model integration (fraction of the cost!)
- Custom Go backend for automation
- Fabric CLI tools for AI prompting
- Cline (AI bot for IDE with OpenRouter access)

## The Current State - Honesty Time ü§î

First thing you're going to notice: this is sloppy! I've created a lot of AI automation and noise across branches. I'm learning Git and GitHub Actions, and I know there are probably hundreds of best practices I didn't follow.

That's exactly why I'm asking for help and mentorship in traditional coding practices, and in return, **I'll teach you all the crazy fast AI automation I've created**.

## Our Business Model üíº

We're building multiple revenue streams:
- **SaaS Products**: freeblog.aireinvestor.com ($7, $25, $75 monthly tiers)
- **Consulting**: AI business transformation (targeting $10k/month for larger clients)
- **Specialized AI Bots**: Domain-specific tools using subdomains (coming soon: sub2.aireinvestor.com for Subject-2 real estate)

## The Big Picture üåü

What's happening is clear: smart developers are taking over marketing. By having aireinvestor.com, we're reaching a huge market of people already using AI to grow their real estate business.

Our marketing plan includes supporting local musicians, creating content across social platforms (TikTok, Facebook, Instagram), and leveraging my background in real estate and AI.

The ultimate goal? Using our revenue to make a real difference - buying properties for charitable donations, supporting organizations like Branch15 (a local ministry in Oklahoma helping trafficked women and children).

*P.S. Remember, I'm an entrepreneur who spells like sh*t, but I guarantee I'll beat a lot of devs operating the "old safe way" without making mistakes. If you understand shell commands, there's nothing we can't build with AI!* üòÑ
